Exploring the Impact of Sleep Patterns on Type 2 Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, Obesity, and Depression


Depression is a common mental disorder. Globally, it is estimated that 5% of adults suffer from the disorder. It is characterized by persistent sadness and a lack of interest or pleasure in previously rewarding or enjoyable activities. It can also disturb sleep and appetite. Tiredness and poor concentration are common. Depression is a leading cause of disability around the world and contributes greatly to the global burden of disease. The effects of depression can be long-lasting or recurrent and can dramatically affect a personâ€™s ability to function and live a rewarding life.

The causes of depression include complex interactions between social, psychological and biological factors. Life events such as childhood adversity, loss and unemployment contribute to and may catalyse the development of depression.

Psychological and pharmacological treatments exist for depression. However, in low- and middle-income countries, treatment and support services for depression are often absent or underdeveloped. It is estimated that more than 75% of people suffering from mental disorders in these countries do not receive treatment.
